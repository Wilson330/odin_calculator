# The Odin Project foundation course: JavaScript part

## Project 5: Calculator

It's a practice to build a calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I tried to imitate the interface and functions of the calculator on IPhone, but I didn't implement the "AC" to "C" function and the digit transformation in fractional-part (just set toFixed(6)).
